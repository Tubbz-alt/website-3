    DEFCON 201 lives in harmony with other hacker, maker and tech organizations in the New Jersey/New York Tri-State Area. In fact, two of our founders are long time regulars at the NYC 2600 group.

    A Project is anything that uses a constructive (or destructive) skill to build something over time. This can be something in physical meat space such as circuit building, radio frequencies, clothing creation, robotics and physical locks to virtual/conceptual pieces such as computer programming, NetOps, InfoSec, virtualization, Red/Blue Team Drills, Data Mining and more. 
    In short, as long as you have an idea that you want to create into a realistic tangible result, please bring it and our members will try to bring it to fruition with the tools and resources of the fine folks at MakerBar!

    We understand if people feel overwhelmed by the idea of working on projects. If you want to show up to socialize, you are more than welcome to but to get the full experience of our group you can use your social skills to help out with projects and DC201.

We are also looking into pure social gatherings in the near future and host short talks on various STEM subjects.
