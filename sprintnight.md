*   Consider feasibility of static site generator
    *   jekyllrb.com or similar
    *   what would be benefits?
        *   "dynamic" content without backend
    *   what about the implications for ease of updating?
*   Above-fold carousel
    *   Displays simple dc201 explanation
    *   Displays next meetings agenda
    *   Displays upcoming large events (ie: Rootz)
    *   Links to whatever appropriate sections
*   Mobile/responsive - whole site
*   Photo gallery?
*   Calendar
    *   Could integrate w/ meetup to filter/display 201 meetings at Makerbar but...
    *   Though 201 can obv. still advertise on MB's meetup, Calendar may make sense as 201 is separate SIG that could occur elsewhere
    *   Plus some people might just be too lazy to click through or not wanna signup on meetup or have opsec reasons
*   Map
    *   Refine map (from openstreet I believe) to better show location?
    *   Perhaps add markers for affilates and upcoming event sites too
    *   Embed mutiple-route chart for public transportation
*   Profile blurbs
    *   Totally opt-in
    *   Include social media, interests, public keys?
    *   If they're comfortable, list con-talks from current members
    *   201 related projects
*   Affiliate logo grid
    *   Fit more logos on one page, similarly sized
    *   Make responsive
    *   Probably remove Fablab, theyve used MBs mailing list for years w/ little to no reciprocation
    *   Probably add Brooklyn OWASP?
    *   Add EFA Alliance logo
*   Social media grid
    *   Smaller icons
    *   Yet very visibly places, probably towards page top
    *   Context/explanation on hover (for some of the more unknown services)
*   Live Twitter feed
*   vectorize the ma-bell logo
*   Rootz info page
*   Low-key yet awesome eye-candy effects on background, behind content
*   Cryptocurrency tickers (segue into eventual crytocurrency themed events)
    *    Bitcoin
    *    Ethereum
*   Does 201 need a serparate phone number? Nobody answers the makerbar number.
